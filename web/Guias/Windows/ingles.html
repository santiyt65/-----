<p> It's as easy as <a href="https://github.com/BrunoSobrino/TheMystic-Bot-MD/releases/download/WInstaller/TheMystic.exe">Downloading‚¨áÔ∏è</a> and Running </p>
<p> That will automatically install everything you need and start asking you to start with QR Code or Phone Number when it finishes installing </p>

<h2>üîÑ Start Bot Again </h2>
<p>To start the bot open TheMystic.exe again and that's it. </p>
<br>
<p>You can also open the folder location where it is and open CMD from there, or directly from CMD with this command <code>cd %USERPROFILE%\mystic && npm start .
</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Windows has a limitation with the Terminal which pauses the execution if it is minimized, in addition to showing pop-ups randomly when using ffmpeg</p>
<p>To solve this you must add a Task in Task Scheduler</p></blockquote>
<p>Open the Task Scheduler and configure it with these options: </p>
<p>Add New Basic or Simple Task</p>
<p>Add Name, Choose TheMystic.EXE and start when the computer starts plus Advanced Settings</p>
<p>Run Whether or not you log in</p>
<p>Adjust so that the task does not stop after 3 days and other preferential settings</p>
